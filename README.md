## Introduction

The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm for text classification and other tasks. It's based on the Bayes' theorem and makes the naive assumption of feature independence. This repository provides hands-on examples and explanations of an introductory Naive Bayes classifier.

## Prerequisites

To work with the notebooks in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Notebooks

This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebooks:

- [Notebook 1]: Introduction to Naive Bayes Classifier with feature engineering and without feature engineering.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdetective007/Introductory_Naive_Bayes_Classifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the `Introductory_Naive_Bayes_Classifier` directory:

```bash
cd Introductory_Naive_Bayes_Classifier/Introductory_Naive_Bayes_Classifier
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Explore and run the notebooks to learn about Naive Bayes classification.

## Dataset

The notebooks use a sample dataset for text classification tasks. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed within each notebook for training, evaluation, and analysis.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

The notebooks introduce the concepts of the Naive Bayes classifier, including probability estimation, Bayes' theorem, and the naive independence assumption. They demonstrate how to implement and use Naive Bayes for text classification.

## Training and Evaluation

The notebooks guide you through the process of training a Naive Bayes classifier using the dataset. They cover techniques for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a foundational understanding of the Naive Bayes classifier and its application in text classification. By following the notebooks, you can gain insights into the principles and practical usage of Naive Bayes.
